Please do not mark this, I am planning on rethinking how to approach this exploration activity. 
I have challenged myself by using this library and I am thinking of new ways to show Keras off as 
I do not feel this appropriately completes the exploration activity even if I got it working.

**1. Which package/library did you select?**
The library that I chose to demonstrate is the Keras library. Which is used to more easily implement neural networks in python.

**2. What is the package/library?**
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;**• What purpose does it serve?**
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This program predicts the genre of a movie based of it's title. The program is trained off of 5k+ titles from Netflix July 2022. The dataset can be found here [dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/victorsoeiro/netflix-tv-shows-and-movies?resource=download)
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;**• How do you use it?**
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;**• This section should be the largest and go into lots of detail. Not everything here must be utilized in your sample program.**
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After running the program through command line the keras model will be trained and validated then you will be asked for a movie title to predict.
<br>
**3. What are the functionalities of the package/library?**
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;**• Snippets of code and examples of output should be given here.**
<br>
4. When was it created?
<br>
**5. Why did you select this package/library?**
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;**• “Because it is interesting” is not a valid answer. Should elaborate more.**
<br>
**6. How did learning the package/library influence your learning of the language?**
<br>
**7. How was your overall experience with the package/library?**
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;**• When would you recommend this package/library to someone?**
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;**• Would you continue using this package/library? Why or why not?**
<br>
